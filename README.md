# Brandubh

## Description
A Python implementation of "Brandubh", a small variant of Norse Tafl games that became the preferred version in Ireland. The rules used here are simplified and included below.

This project is the spiritual successor of a previous attempt to code a full version of Copenhagen Hnefatafl and train a superhuman RL agent to play the game. That attempt was archived due to issues with training the agent.
